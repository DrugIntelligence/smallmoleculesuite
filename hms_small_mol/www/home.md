<p>&emsp;&emsp;<b><a href = "/apps/SelectivitySelectR/" style = "color:#EC4353;">SelectivitySelectR</a></b> shows the affinity and selectivity of compounds in the <a href = "http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/db/sm/">HMS-LINCS collection</a> for a gene of interest. To use SelectivitySelectR, first select your target of interest and binding criteria. Subsequently, select a region in the main plot with compounds of your interest. You can then select three compounds in the bottom table and view their known binding affinities in detail.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;<b><a href = "/apps/apps/SimilaritySelectR/" style = "color: #00AC9F;">SimilaritySelectR</a></b> shows the similarity of compounds in the <a href = "http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/db/sm/">HMS-LINCS collection</a> to a reference compound. Similarity is regarded in threefold: structural similarity (Tanimoto similarity of Morgan2 fingerprints), target affinity spectrum similarity (TAS) and phenotypic fingerprint similarity (PFP). To use SimilaritySelectR, select a reference compound and adjust filters as desired. From the main plots, select a region with compounds of interest. Then, select up to three compounds in the bottom table and view their known binding affinities in detail.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;<b><a href = "/apps/LibraryR/" style = "color: orange">LibraryR</a></b> composes custom chemical genetics libraries for gene-sets of interest. Compounds in the library are selected based on affinity, selectivity, structural similarity and clinical development phase. Additionally we source several expert opinion "best-in-class" lists. To use LibraryR, simply submit a list of genes for which the library should be designed, or load one of the example gene-sets, click 'Submit' and adjust the inclusion criteria to fit your research purpose. The library will be adjusted based on the input genes and inclusion criteria.
